# Neovim Configs


## Repo details

This repo is managed out of `$HOME/.config/nvim`.
It does not need to be a bare repo---we keep no files in `$HOME` (we bypass `.vimrc` entirely).

## to-do

- neovim package loading
    - what needs `require()`

- remove unnecessary / complected pieces

        - comments
        - work snips (users.mdecrescenzo)
        - language scoping
    - ripgrep / fd
    - cmp (fix `<CR>` trigger)
    - lsp
    - telescope
    - treesitter
    - neotree (project)?

- lower priority
