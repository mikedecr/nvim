# Neovim Configs


## Details

This repo is managed out of `~/.config/nvim`.
No need to be a bare repo: it is entirely separate from other dotfiles repositories, we keep no files under `~/`, and we bypass `~/.vimrc` altogether.

## Agenda:

- [ ] neovim package loading
    - what needs `require()`
    - resolve plug.lua instances
- [ ] replace lspinstall
- [ ] remove unnecessary / complected pieces
    - stick to well-understood modules
- [ ] git signs etc.

- give time to...
    - snippets
        - comments
        - work snips (users.mdecrescenzo)
        - language scoping
    - cmp (fix `<CR>` trigger?)
    - lsp
    - telescope
    - treesitter
    - neotree (project)?
- lower priority
    - explore symbol sets
    - markdown completion
